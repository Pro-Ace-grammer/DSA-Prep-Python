Task 6: Factorial of a Number
Write an algorithm to find the factorial of a number using both recursive and iterative approaches. Analyze the time and space complexity of both methods.

# Iterative Algorithm:
- For all the values form 1 to N.
- multiply the values one by one to the previous product.
- Keep multiplying for all the values till N.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)


# Recursive Algorithm:
- Call a function with argument N.
- Check if N==1 which is the ase condition.
- If true then return 1.
- If not then calll the function multiplied by N, by passing the argument as (N-1) for the funciton.
- And repeat the process till the base condition is true.
- then return the factorial calculated.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
