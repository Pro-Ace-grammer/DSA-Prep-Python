Task 7: Check if a Number is Prime
Write an algorithm to check whether a given number is prime or not. Analyze its time and space complexity.

# Algorithm:
- For all the numbers from 2 to N-1 (lets say 'i').
- check if N is divisible by any of the numbers (i)
- if divisible then return False.
- If not divisible by any of the numbers then return True.

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
