Task 4: Bubble Sort Algorithm
Write an algorithm to sort an array using the bubble sort technique. Then, analyze its time and space complexity.

# Algorithm:
- for each element in an array
- compare adjescent the elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order (i.e. if the right element is greater than the left one).
- repeat this process for all the elements in an array.
- After each full pass the largest element bubbles up to its correct position.
- continue till the array is sorted.

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1)
