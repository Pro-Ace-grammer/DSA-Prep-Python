Task 1: Linear Search Algorithm
Write an algorithm to perform a linear search on an array to find an element. Then, analyze its time and space complexity.

Algorithm
- Start
- for each element in the given array
-   if the element matches the target, return its index
- if no match then return -1.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)


for i in range(len(array)):
    if array[i] == target:
        return i
return -1
