Task 5: Reverse an Array
Write an algorithm to reverse an array in place. Then, analyze its time and space complexity.

#Algorithm:
- Set two pointers as 'start' (which points to the 0th index) and 'end' (which points to the last index).
- swap the values present at these two pointers. 
- increment the 'start' and decrement the 'end'.
- And repeat the process till the start is equal or greater than end.
