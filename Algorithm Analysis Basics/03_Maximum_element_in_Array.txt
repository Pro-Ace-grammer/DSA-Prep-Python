Task 3: Find the Maximum Element in an Array
Write an algorithm to find the maximum element in an unsorted array. Then, analyze its time and space complexity.


# ALGORITHM:
- Initialize a variable, eg: take 'max_num' auxiliary space with -infinity as value.
- for each element in the array 
- check if the element is greater than the max_num value 
- if yes then assign the elements value to the max_num, and if not then continue.
- repeat the process for the entire lenght of the collection.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space complexity: O(1)
